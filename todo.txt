# Code Review TODO List

### Architecture
- [ ] Consider asset optimization pipeline
  - Offload optimize images script (or something like it) to CI. I should just
    create the photos dir. Handle it gracefully locally.
  - Use a library like sharp to generate optimized images. make sure all photos
    have corresponding optimized versions in ci maybe?
  - Image compression step in CI
  - Generate WebP/AVIF formats
  - Add responsive image srcset
  - May be overkill for personal site
